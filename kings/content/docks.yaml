  The smell of fish overwhelms you as you approach Nanook's docks.  The road travel through the center of the fish market where numerous fishmongers haggle with customers at their stalls.  
  Immediately to the east, you see a small road going past a smaller market.  Further north, you hear the sound of hammering coming from the entrance to the boat foundry.  The road continues to the northwest and bends past a small park.  Directly to the west is a well travelled cobblestone walkway leading to several stores.
